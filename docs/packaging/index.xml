Releases Release numbers use SemVer. The version is to be put in the filename and the package.json file.
The intention is that each release corresponds to a commit. To this end if you are making a new release version of the package:
Make sure you have no modified files (check your git status - the script does this for you) Add a tag on your current commit with the release number, push the tag to the origin repo Building (Script) There&amp;rsquo;s a simple build script included in the project.</description></item></channel></rss>
