These work together to provide a fixed endpoint that allows users to rendezvous over the internet, where service discovery is impossible.
The Rooms system - the RoomClient and RoomServer - provide the concepts of Rooms and Peers. A Peer is a remote player. A Room is a place that multiple Peers can join. The example Server implements a RoomServer that allows Peers to find and join Rooms, and facilitates message exchange between the Rooms members.</description></item><item><title>Server Overview</title><link>https://ucl-vr.github.io/ubiq-website/docs/servers-and-rooms/server-overview/</link><pubDate>Mon, 21 Sep 2020 16:00:43 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://ucl-vr.github.io/ubiq-website/docs/servers-and-rooms/server-overview/</guid><description>Overview The Room Server service consists of a number of objects that work together to route messages to either the command and control interface on the server itself, or to other peers.
RoomClient Connections The NetworkScene itself does not create any connections.
In the Ubiq sample code, the RoomClient is responsible for making the initial connection to the rendezvous server. The RoomClient has a pre-shared IP and port, which it assumes points to an endpoint with a Room Server running.</description></item><item><title>Heartbeat and Timeouts</title><link>https://ucl-vr.github.io/ubiq-website/docs/servers-and-rooms/heartbeat/</link><pubDate>Mon, 21 Sep 2020 16:00:43 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://ucl-vr.github.io/ubiq-website/docs/servers-and-rooms/heartbeat/</guid><description>Heartbeat RoomClient instances will ping the RoomServer at a 1 Hz. If they do not receive a response after 5 seconds, they consider the server to have timed out, and will notify the user.
Timeouts If a client drops a connection to a server, the server will inform all other peers by emitting OnPeerRemoved.
The server will only remove a client when the underlying TCP connection has been closed. Until this time the client may re-appear.</description></item><item><title>Leaving and Joining</title><link>https://ucl-vr.github.io/ubiq-website/docs/servers-and-rooms/leaving-joining/</link><pubDate>Mon, 21 Sep 2020 16:00:43 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://ucl-vr.github.io/ubiq-website/docs/servers-and-rooms/leaving-joining/</guid><description>When a RoomClient starts it is automatically a member of an empty, unidentified, room.
A RoomClient can create a new room or join an existing one at any time. Joining or leaving a room involes a room change. Changing the room is the same whether the client is going to or from an empty room, or between non-empty rooms.
When the room changes RoomClient will emit a number of events, in order:</description></item></channel></rss>
