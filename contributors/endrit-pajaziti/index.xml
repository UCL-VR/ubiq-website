Endrit is a researcher at the Institute of Cardiovascular Science and co-creator of VheaRts. Previously the VheaRts team wrote about their experiences working with Ubiq to demo VheaRts at the WCPCCS conference (link). They&amp;rsquo;ve since extended out their application to aid real-time clinical training. Thanks Endrit for sharing this with us! &amp;ndash; Ben Congdon
