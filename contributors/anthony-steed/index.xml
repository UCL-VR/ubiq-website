Messages from rooms are duplicated or &amp;ldquo;fanned-out&amp;rdquo;. This implementation is simple and robust, but can create a choke-point when large numbers of users congregate in one room: and this is what the paper is focused on.
To see why this is, and understand the paper&amp;rsquo;s goals, we need a wider view of scalability in social VR&amp;hellip;</description></item><item><title>Dialogues For One: Single-User Content Creation Using Immersive Record and Replay</title><link>https://ubiq.online/publication/dialogues-for-one/</link><pubDate>Wed, 11 Oct 2023 00:00:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://ubiq.online/publication/dialogues-for-one/</guid><description>ℹ️ The Unity project and dataset are available here.

A very wide variety of social virtual reality (SVR) applications are now available from competitive games amongst small numbers of players through to conference-like setups supporting dozens of visitors.
Ubiq is an open source tool that allows developers to very quickly build SVR applications. In this short tutorial, we will introduce some of the capabilities of Ubiq, demonstrate some of the tools it has, and work through a complete example of how to build a non-trivial application including custom distributed behaviours.</description></item><item><title>Ubiq-Genie: Leveraging External Frameworks for Enhanced Social VR Experiences</title><link>https://ubiq.online/publication/ubiq-genie/</link><pubDate>Wed, 25 Jan 2023 09:19:42 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://ubiq.online/publication/ubiq-genie/</guid><description>ℹ️ The source code of Ubiq-Genie is available on GitHub and is licensed under the Apache 2.0 License.
