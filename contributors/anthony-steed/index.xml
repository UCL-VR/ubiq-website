Summary In this tutorial we will explore how to build a wide variety of collaborative extended reality (XR) systems using the Ubiq software. Ubiq is an open source platform. It is designed to be easily extensible. It enables development of applications or systems that would be difficult or time-consuming on commercial systems. The tutorial will start with basic concepts, but then explore how more complete demonstrations can be built using new features that have been built on Ubiq in the past couple of years.</description></item><item><title>StreamSpace: A Framework for Window Streaming in Collaborative Mixed Reality Environments</title><link>https://ubiq.online/publication/streamspace/</link><pubDate>Sat, 16 Mar 2024 02:00:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://ubiq.online/publication/streamspace/</guid><description> Cite with BibTex @inproceedings{giunchiStreamSpace2024, title = {{StreamSpace}}: {{A Framework for Window Streaming}} in {{Collaborative Mixed Reality Environments}}, booktitle = {2024 {{IEEE Conference}} on {{Virtual Reality}} and {{3D User Interfaces Abstracts}} and {{Workshops}} ({{VRW}})}, author = {Giunchi, Daniele and Bovo, Riccardo and Numan, Nels and Steed, Anthony}, publisher = {IEEE}, address = {Orlando, USA}, year = {2024}, doi = {10.1109/VRW62533.2024.00226} }</description></item><item><title>AccompliceVR: Lending Assistance to Immersed Users by Adding a Generic Collaborative Layer</title><link>https://ubiq.online/publication/accomplicevr/</link><pubDate>Sat, 16 Mar 2024 01:00:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://ubiq.online/publication/accomplicevr/</guid><description> Cite with BibTex @inproceedings{giunchiStreamSpace2024, title = {{AccompliceVR}}: {{Lending Assistance to Immersed Users by Adding a Generic Collaborative Layer}}, booktitle = {2024 {{IEEE Conference}} on {{Virtual Reality}} and {{3D User Interfaces Abstracts}} and {{Workshops}} ({{VRW}})}, author = {Steed, Anthony}, publisher = {IEEE}, address = {Orlando, USA}, year = {2024}, doi = {10.1109/VRW62533.2024.00180} }</description></item><item><title>AIsop: Exploring Immersive VR Storytelling Leveraging Generative AI</title><link>https://ubiq.online/publication/aisop/</link><pubDate>Sat, 16 Mar 2024 01:00:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://ubiq.online/publication/aisop/</guid><description> Cite with BibTex @inproceedings{gattiAIsop2024, title = {{AIsop}}: {{Exploring Immersive VR Storytelling Leveraging Generative AI} booktitle = {2024 {{IEEE Conference}} on {{Virtual Reality}} and {{3D User Interfaces Abstracts}} and {{Workshops}} ({{VRW}})}, author = {Gatti, Elia and Giunchi, Daniele and Numan, Nels and Steed, Anthony}, publisher = {IEEE}, address = {Orlando, USA}, doi = {10.1109/VRW62533.2024.00229} }</description></item><item><title>DreamCodeVR: Towards Democratizing Behavior Design in Virtual Reality with Speech-Driven Programming</title><link>https://ubiq.online/publication/dreamcodevr/</link><pubDate>Sat, 16 Mar 2024 01:00:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://ubiq.online/publication/dreamcodevr/</guid><description> Cite with BibTex @inproceedings{giunchiDreamCodeVRDemocratizingBehavior2024, title = {{{DreamCodeVR}}: {{Towards Democratizing Behavior Design}} in {{Virtual Reality}} with {{Speech-Driven Programming}}}, booktitle = {2024 {{IEEE Conference Virtual Reality}} and {{3D User Interfaces}} ({{VR}})}, author = {Giunchi, Daniele and Numan, Nels and Gatti, Elia and Steed, Anthony}, publisher = {IEEE}, address = {Orlando, USA}, year = {2024}, doi = {10.1109/VR58804.2024.00078} }</description></item><item><title>Server Scalability at DS-RT 23</title><link>https://ubiq.online/blog/server-scalability-at-ds-rt-23/</link><pubDate>Thu, 07 Dec 2023 10:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ubiq.online/blog/server-scalability-at-ds-rt-23/</guid><description>Ubiq is logically Peer to Peer, but when communicating over the public internet the Ubiq server is used as a hub. Messages from rooms are duplicated or &amp;ldquo;fanned-out&amp;rdquo;. This implementation is simple and robust, but can create a choke-point when large numbers of users congregate in one room: and this is what the paper is focused on.
To see why this is, and understand the paper&amp;rsquo;s goals, we need a wider view of scalability in social VR&amp;hellip;</description></item><item><title>Supporting Co-Presence in Populated Virtual Environments by Actor Takeover of Animated Characters</title><link>https://ubiq.online/publication/takeover-ismar2023/</link><pubDate>Mon, 16 Oct 2023 00:00:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://ubiq.online/publication/takeover-ismar2023/</guid><description>ℹ️ The Unity project are available on Github.

A very wide variety of social virtual reality (SVR) applications are now available from competitive games amongst small numbers of players through to conference-like setups supporting dozens of visitors.
Ubiq is an open source tool that allows developers to very quickly build SVR applications. In this short tutorial, we will introduce some of the capabilities of Ubiq, demonstrate some of the tools it has, and work through a complete example of how to build a non-trivial application including custom distributed behaviours.</description></item></channel></rss>
