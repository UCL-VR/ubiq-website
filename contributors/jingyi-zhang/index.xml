Summary In this tutorial we will explore how to build a wide variety of collaborative extended reality (XR) systems using the Ubiq software. Ubiq is an open source platform. It is designed to be easily extensible. It enables development of applications or systems that would be difficult or time-consuming on commercial systems. The tutorial will start with basic concepts, but then explore how more complete demonstrations can be built using new features that have been built on Ubiq in the past couple of years.</description></item><item><title>Improved Takeover System: Enabling Single Actor Control for Multi-Avatar Populated Virtual Realities</title><link>https://ucl-vr.github.io/ubiq-website/publication/takeover-ismar2024/</link><pubDate>Mon, 02 Dec 2024 00:00:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://ucl-vr.github.io/ubiq-website/publication/takeover-ismar2024/</guid><description> Cite with BibTex @INPROCEEDINGS{10765328, author={Zhang, Jingyi and Steed, Anthony}, booktitle={2024 IEEE International Symposium on Mixed and Augmented Reality Adjunct (ISMAR-Adjunct)}, title={Improved Takeover System: Enabling Single Actor Control for Multi-Avatar Populated Virtual Realities}, year={2024}, volume={}, number={}, pages={612-613}, keywords={Human computer interaction;Avatars;Artificial intelligence;Augmented reality;Human computer interaction (HCI);virtual reality;social virtual reality}, doi={10.1109/ISMAR-Adjunct64951.2024.00175}}</description></item><item><title>Single Actor, Multiple Roles</title><link>https://ucl-vr.github.io/ubiq-website/blog/single-actor-multiple-roles/</link><pubDate>Fri, 05 Jan 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ucl-vr.github.io/ubiq-website/blog/single-actor-multiple-roles/</guid><description>We presented our paper Supporting Co-Presence in Populated Virtual Environments by Actor Takeover of Animated Characters at ISMAR 2023.
The advancement of consumer virtual reality (VR) systems and high-speed internet services has enabled a broad range of new social virtual reality (SVR) applications. To create experiences that appear to be densely populated we can augment users with avatars representing autonomous agent simulations. Such agents might have a similar appearance as user avatars and thus the user might expect them to have at least some reactive and communicative behaviours.</description></item><item><title>Supporting Co-Presence in Populated Virtual Environments by Actor Takeover of Animated Characters</title><link>https://ucl-vr.github.io/ubiq-website/publication/takeover-ismar2023/</link><pubDate>Mon, 16 Oct 2023 00:00:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://ucl-vr.github.io/ubiq-website/publication/takeover-ismar2023/</guid><description>ℹ️ The Unity project are available on Github.
