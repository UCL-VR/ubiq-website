Ubiq is an open source tool that allows developers to very quickly build SVR applications. In this short tutorial, we will introduce some of the capabilities of Ubiq, demonstrate some of the tools it has, and work through a complete example of how to build a non-trivial application including custom distributed behaviours.</description></item><item><title>Ubiq-Genie: Leveraging External Frameworks for Enhanced Social VR Experiences</title><link>https://ubiq.online/publication/ubiq-genie/</link><pubDate>Wed, 25 Jan 2023 09:19:42 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://ubiq.online/publication/ubiq-genie/</guid><description>‚ÑπÔ∏è The source code of Ubiq-Genie is available on GitHub and is licensed under the Apache 2.0 License.

Our main goal was to simplify object addressing and initialisation - to make creating networked objects as quick and easy as possible, and avoid messages ending up where they aren&amp;rsquo;t expected.
Another, separate, goal was the ability to automatically synchronise Components, for those who just want to build networked objects as quickly as possible.</description></item><item><title>Ubiq-Exp: a Toolkit to Build and Run Remote and Distributed Mixed Reality Experiments</title><link>https://ubiq.online/publication/ubiq-exp/</link><pubDate>Thu, 25 Aug 2022 09:19:42 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://ubiq.online/publication/ubiq-exp/</guid><description>‚ÑπÔ∏è Source code for Ubiq-Exp will be posted to this page soon!
