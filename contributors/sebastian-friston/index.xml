A very wide variety of social virtual reality (SVR) applications are now available from competitive games amongst small numbers of players through to conference-like setups supporting dozens of visitors.
Ubiq is an open source tool that allows developers to very quickly build SVR applications. In this short tutorial, we will introduce some of the capabilities of Ubiq, demonstrate some of the tools it has, and work through a complete example of how to build a non-trivial application including custom distributed behaviours.</description></item><item><title>Serving Secure WebSockets</title><link>https://ubiq.online/blog/serving-secure-websockets/</link><pubDate>Fri, 02 Dec 2022 09:19:42 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://ubiq.online/blog/serving-secure-websockets/</guid><description>Introduction Ubiq 0.0.3 supports building for WebGL out-of-the-box in Unity.
Ubiq has always supported Javascript clients, but now users have the option of building native browser clients, or building for the web directly in Unity.
WebGL support is experimental, and some features are still a work in progress, such as Voice Chat.
This post is not about building for the browser however, but what it required to support the browser behind the scenes&amp;hellip;</description></item><item><title>Extending the server</title><link>https://ubiq.online/blog/extending-the-server/</link><pubDate>Mon, 07 Nov 2022 09:19:42 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://ubiq.online/blog/extending-the-server/</guid><description>Introduction Ubiq sessions are made up of Peers connected in a Peer Group.
By default, peers join Rooms on the server. Each room is a peer group, and group members exchange all messages with all other members.
This is just one possibility however&amp;hellip;
In this post we show how to extend the server without making upstream code changes, so we can implement different multicasting behaviours, and so build different peer groups, for research and experimentation.</description></item><item><title>Latest API improvements</title><link>https://ubiq.online/blog/latest-api-improvements/</link><pubDate>Wed, 19 Oct 2022 09:19:42 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://ubiq.online/blog/latest-api-improvements/</guid><description>Introduction In Ubiq 0.0.3 we have made a number of changes to improve ease of use.
Our main goal was to simplify object addressing and initialisation - to make creating networked objects as quick and easy as possible, and avoid messages ending up where they aren&amp;rsquo;t expected.
Another, separate, goal was the ability to automatically synchronise Components, for those who just want to build networked objects as quickly as possible.</description></item><item><title>Ubiq-Exp: a Toolkit to Build and Run Remote and Distributed Mixed Reality Experiments</title><link>https://ubiq.online/publication/ubiq-exp/</link><pubDate>Thu, 25 Aug 2022 09:19:42 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://ubiq.online/publication/ubiq-exp/</guid><description>‚ÑπÔ∏è Source code for Ubiq-Exp will be posted to this page soon!
