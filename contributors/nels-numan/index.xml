For example, recent advances in generative AI provide the ability to synthesize textual, auditory, or visual data, enabling new types of virtual experiences. However, these applications often require a high level of processing power, which is typically not available on untethered mixed-reality devices.
Ubiq-Genie addresses this by building on the open-source Ubiq social VR platform and provides a modular approach to server-assisted social VR applications.</description></item><item><title>Ubiq-Genie: Leveraging External Frameworks for Enhanced Social VR Experiences</title><link>https://ubiq.online/publication/ubiq-genie/</link><pubDate>Wed, 25 Jan 2023 09:19:42 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://ubiq.online/publication/ubiq-genie/</guid><description>ℹ️ The source code of Ubiq-Genie is available on GitHub and is licensed under the Apache 2.0 License.

A very wide variety of social virtual reality (SVR) applications are now available; from competitive games amongst small numbers of players; through to conference-like setups supporting dozens of visitors. Indeed many participants at ISMAR 2022 will be experiencing at least some of the conference through a SVR application. The implementations strategies of different SVR applications are very diverse, with few standards or conventions to follow.</description></item></channel></rss>
