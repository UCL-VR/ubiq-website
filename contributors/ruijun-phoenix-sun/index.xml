Summary In this tutorial we will explore how to build a wide variety of collaborative extended reality (XR) systems using the Ubiq software. Ubiq is an open source platform. It is designed to be easily extensible. It enables development of applications or systems that would be difficult or time-consuming on commercial systems. The tutorial will start with basic concepts, but then explore how more complete demonstrations can be built using new features that have been built on Ubiq in the past couple of years.</description></item></channel></rss>
