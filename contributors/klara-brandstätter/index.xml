With the help of indicators showing when a recorded avatar would speak or grab an object, a single user could create believable conversations and object interactions with their previously recorded self. Watch the video to see how we created single-user dialogues and object interaction! In the past, we implemented a record and replay tool in Ubiq with which we could easily populate a virtual space with many characters by recording over previous replays.</description></item><item><title>Dialogues For One: Single-User Content Creation Using Immersive Record and Replay</title><link>https://ubiq.online/publication/dialogues-for-one/</link><pubDate>Wed, 11 Oct 2023 00:00:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://ubiq.online/publication/dialogues-for-one/</guid><description>‚ÑπÔ∏è The Unity project and dataset are available here.
