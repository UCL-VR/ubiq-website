abstract: "
Virtual Reality (VR) presents an immersive platform for storytelling, allowing narratives to unfold in highly engaging, interactive environments. Leveraging AI capabilities and image synthesis offers new possibilities for creating scalable, generative VR content. In this work, we use an LLM-driven VR storytelling platform to explore how AI-generated visuals and narrative elements impact the user experience in VR storytelling. Previously, we presented AIsop, a system to integrate LLM-generated text and images and TTS audio into a storytelling experience, where the narrative unfolds based on user input. In this paper, we present two user studies focusing on how AI-generated visuals influence narrative perception and the overall VR experience. Our findings highlight the positive impact of AI-generated pictorial content on the storytelling experience, highlighting areas for enhancement and further research in interactive narrative design.
