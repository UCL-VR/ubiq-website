title: "AccompliceVR: Lending Assistance to Immersed Users by Adding a Generic Collaborative Layer"
description: ""
abstract: "The current model of development for virtual reality applications is that a single application is responsible for construction of the main immersive experience. If the application is collaborative, that application must implement the required network functionality. We present VRAccomplice an overlay application that adds a collaboration layer to applications running on SteamVr. Using the Ubiq software, we can add avatars controlled by remote users as an overlay into running application. Remote users can see video of the local user. We demonstrate this with some simple examples of a remote user helping a local user in two popular SteamVr games."
