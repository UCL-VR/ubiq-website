title: "StreamSpace: A Framework for Window Streaming in Collaborative Mixed Reality Environments"
description: ""
abstract: "We introduce StreamSpace as a framework for exploring screen-based collaborative mixed-reality (MR) experiences, focusing on the streaming, integration, and layout of screen content in MR environments. Utilizing Unity and Ubiq, this framework allows users to engage with, reposition, and resize uniquely identified screens within a user-centric virtual space. Building on Ubiqâ€™s WebRTC capabilities, our framework enables real-time streaming and transformations through peer-to-peer communication. Key features of StreamSpace include distributed streaming, automated screen layout, and flexible privacy settings for virtual screens. By introducing StreamSpace, we aim to provide a foundational basis for research on screen-based collaborative MR applications."
