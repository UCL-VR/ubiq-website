title: "Ubiq-Exp: a Toolkit to Build and Run Remote and Distributed Mixed Reality Experiments"
description: ""
abstract: "Developing mixed-reality (MR) experiments is a challenge as there is a wide variety of functionality to support. This challenge is exacerbated if the MR experiment is multi-user or if the experiment needs to be run out of the lab. We present Ubiq-Exp - a set of tools that provide a variety of functionality to facilitate distributed and remote MR experiments. We motivate our design patterns and tools from recent practice in the field and a desire to build experiments that are easier to reproduce. Key features are the ability to support synchronous and asynchronous experiments, and a variety of tools for the experimenter to facilitate operation and documentation of the experimental sessions. We illustrate the potential of the tools through three small-scale pilot experiments. Our tools and pilot experiments are released under a permissive open-source license to enable developers to appropriate and develop them further for their own needs."
