title: "Towards Outdoor Collaborative Mixed Reality: Lessons Learnt from a Prototype System"
description: ""
abstract: "Most research on collaborative mixed reality (CMR) has focused on indoor spaces. In this paper, we present our ongoing work aimed at investigating the potential of CMR in outdoor spaces. These spaces present unique challenges due to their larger and more complex nature, particularly in terms of reconstruction, tracking, and interaction. Our prototype system utilises a photorealistic model to facilitate collaboration between remote virtual reality (VR) users and a local augmented reality (AR) user. We discuss our design considerations, lessons learnt, and areas for future work."
