Ubiq can be downloaded from the UCL VR Github: [https://github.com/UCL-VR/ubiq](https://github.com/UCL-VR/ubiq)

## WebRTC

Ubiq relies on WebRTC for voice and video chat. The repository includes binaries for Windows, Linux, Android and MacOS, so you do not need to download anything else. The project to build the binaries though can also be found on the UCL VR Github.
